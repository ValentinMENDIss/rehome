# ReHome - Home Manager for your Dotfiles (Inspired by NixOS)

ReHome - is a shell script which can copy ("pull") and paste ("push") your config files/dotfiles from the system.

### How does it work?

ReHome shell script creates a new config file/text file where it can store every configuration file you want or need.
This might be config files for basic applications like (btop, neofetch, etc...). But also this can be WM's config files.
Such as (bspwm, sxhkd, polybar, rofi, etc...).

### Status of the tool

To get you know about the project, we will write the current status of the tool right here. Yeah right here :)

**IN DEVELOPMENT (ALPHA-RELEASE)**

# Basic Installation Guide

To install this shell script you will need to install these package:
**gum**
Official github repository of gum: https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum


P.S: If we will see that using gum is not really needed and the difference between the regular shell script and shell script with the gum interfac
is not huge for user-friendliness/use-easiness, we will stop using it.


Now just run the shell script.
